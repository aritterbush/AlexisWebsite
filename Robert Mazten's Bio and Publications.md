Robert Matzen takes a different approach to the traditional Hollywood authorship, in part using storytelling skills honed as a feature documentary filmmaker. He also makes a commitment to get the inside story on subjects he covers, relying on primary sources, original interviews, and site visits.

Robert's tenth book is also his debut novel. "Season of the Gods" draws upon his in-depth knowledge of Warner Bros. studio, expertise in World War II, and background in film production to tell the spellbinding story of Warner Bros. Story Editor Irene Lee's quest to bring the wartime masterpiece "Casablanca" to the screen. His previous nonfiction books include "Warrior: Audrey Hepburn" and the international bestseller "Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn in World War II," both written in collaboration with Hepburn's son Luca Dotti. Prior to that, Matzen wrote "Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe" and "Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3," both of which leveraged his 10 years working for NASA Headquarters in aeronautics. "Mission" continues to earn national media interest, and "Fireball" earned praise from the Smithsonian, and won the 2015 Benjamin Franklin Award for Biography.

With every book, Matzen gets personal with history. For "Season of the Gods" he explored the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. For "Dutch Girl" he spent months in the Netherlands talking to the people who lived through the war with Audrey Hepburn. For "Mission" he flew in B-17 and B-24 bombers and walked the muddy fields of Jimmy Stewart's base at Tibenham, England. And for "Fireball," he famously climbed a mountain--Mount Potosi, Nevada--to explore the wreckage of TWA Flight 3.

In the Dutch Girl book, it is about twenty-five years after her passing, Audrey Hepburn remains the most beloved of all Hollywood stars, known as much for her role as UNICEF ambassador as for films like Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's. 
Several biographies have chronicled her stardom, but none has covered her intense experiences through five years of Nazi occupation in the Netherlands. 
According to her son, Luca Dotti, "The war made my mother who she was." Audrey Hepburn's war included participation in the Dutch Resistance, working as a doctor's assistant during the "Bridge Too Far" battle of Arnhem, the brutal execution of her uncle, and the ordeal of the Hunger Winter of 1944. 
She also had to contend with the fact that her father was a Nazi agent and her mother was pro-Nazi for the first two years of the occupation.
 But the war years also brought triumphs as Audrey became Arnhem's most famous young ballerina. 
 Audrey's own reminiscences, new interviews with people who knew her in the war, wartime diaries, and research in classified Dutch archives shed light on the riveting, untold story of Audrey Hepburn under fire in World War II.
 Also included is a section of color and black-and-white photos. Many of these images are from Audrey's personal collection and are published here for the first time.
