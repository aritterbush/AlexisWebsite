This is my favortie author Robert Matzen. 
Robert Matzen takes a different approach to the traditional Hollywood authorship, in part using storytelling skills honed as a feature documentary filmmaker. 
He also makes a commitment to get the inside story on subjects he covers, relying on primary sources, original interviews, and site visits.

Robert's tenth book is also his debut novel. "Season of the Gods" draws upon his in-depth knowledge of Warner Bros. studio, expertise in World War II, and background in film production to tell the spellbinding story of Warner Bros. 
Story Editor Irene Lee's quest to bring the wartime masterpiece "Casablanca" to the screen. His previous nonfiction books include "Warrior: Audrey Hepburn" and the international bestseller "Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn in World War II," both written in collaboration with Hepburn's son Luca Dotti.
 Prior to that, Matzen wrote "Mission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe" and "Fireball: Carole Lombard and the Mystery of Flight 3," both of which leveraged his 10 years working for NASA Headquarters in aeronautics. "Mission" continues to earn national media interest, and "Fireball" earned praise from the Smithsonian, and won the 2015 Benjamin Franklin Award for Biography.
